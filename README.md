# Pet API - Readme

This SpringBoot application uses the openapi-generator-maven-plugin plugin to generate the I/O class models and the RESTcontroller interface from the OpenAPI specification, all the classes will be generated by the mvn install command.

Here are some consideration about the implementation:

- The input data validation is executed directly within the controller, according to the constraints defined in the OpenAPI specification
- The database access is mocked using H2
- The "planned database refactoring" requirement has been satisfied by using an implemention-agnostic PetRepository interface that has been implemented by a class that use a JPA repository as delegate and is compiled only with , but other implementations could be added. The @Profile annotation can be used to define a "relational" or "nosql" profile that allow to chose which implementation to run only by changing the active profile in the application.properties file.
